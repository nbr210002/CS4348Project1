This project implements a simple encryption system in Java, consisting of three programs:
Driver.java – This is the main program interacting with the user. It launches the logger and encryption processes and manages communication.
Encryption.java – This handles encryption and decryption of text using a Vigenère cipher. It stores a passkey for operations.
Logger.java – This logs all actions performed by the driver program, including user commands and results, with timestamps.

To compile:
type in: javac Driver.java Encryption.java Logger.java
run the driver with a log filename argument: java Driver log.txt
lastly, interact with the program using commands from the menu.
